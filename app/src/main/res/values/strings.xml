    <string name="article"> A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character,and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco,Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas\n
    <b><i>The result </i></b> is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchellexplores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.
\n<b><i>Cloud Atlas</i></b>begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .\n
Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . .\n
From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life.\n
And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.
